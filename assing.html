    <h2 class="heading"> Classical mysticism </h2>
    <p> <i> 
        The introduction of the element of love, which changed asceticism into mysticism, is ascribed to <strong> Rābiʿah al-ʿAdawīyah </strong>(died 801), a woman from Basra who first formulated the Sufi ideal of a love of Allah (<strong> God</strong>) that was disinterested, without hope for paradise and without fear of hell. In the decades after Rābiʿah, mystical trends grew everywhere in the Islamic world, partly through an exchange of ideas with Christian hermits. A number of mystics in the early generations had concentrated their efforts upon tawakkul, absolute trust in God, which became a central concept of Sufism. An Iraqi school of mysticism became noted for its strict self-control and psychological insight. The Iraqi school was initiated by<strong>  al-Muḥāsibī</strong> (died 857)—who believed that purging the soul in preparation for companionship with God was the only value of asceticism. Its teachings of classical sobriety and wisdom were perfected by Junayd of <strong> Baghdad</strong> (died 910), to whom all later chains of the transmission of doctrine and legitimacy go back. In an Egyptian school of Sufism, the <strong> Nubian Dhū al-Nūn </strong>(died 859) reputedly introduced the technical term maʿ rifah (“<strong> interior knowledge</strong>”), as contrasted to learnedness; in his hymnical prayers he joined all nature in the praise of God—an idea based on the Qurʾān and later elaborated in Persian and Turkish poetry. In the Iranian school,<strong>  Abū Yazīd al-Bisṭāmī </strong>(died 874) is usually considered to have been representative of the important doctrine of annihilation of the self, fanāʾ; the strange symbolism of his sayings prefigures part of the terminology of later mystical poets. At the same time the concept of divine love became more central, especially among the Iraqi Sufis. Its main representatives are Nūrī, who offered his life for his brethren, and Sumnūn “<strong> the Lover</strong>.”
