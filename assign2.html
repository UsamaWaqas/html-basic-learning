            Though a Hadith (a recorded saying of the Prophet Muhammad) claims that<strong>  “he who knows God becomes silent,”</strong> the Sufis have produced a literature of impressive extent and could defend their writing activities with another Hadith: <strong> “He who knows God talks much.”</strong> The first systematic books explaining the tenets of Sufism date from the 10th century; but earlier, Muḥāsibī had already written about spiritual education, Ḥallāj had composed meditations in highly concentrated language, and many Sufis had used poetry for conveying their experiences of the ineffable mystery or had instructed their disciples in letters of cryptographic density. The accounts of Sufism by Sarrāj and his followers, as well as the ṭabaqāt (biographical works) by <strong> Sulamī, Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī,</strong> and others, together with some biographies of individual masters, are the sources for knowledge of early Sufism.

            Early mystical commentaries on the <strong> Qurʾān </strong>  are partly extant, often preserved in fragmentary quotations in later sources. With the formation of mystical orders, books about the behaviour of the Sufi in various situations became important, although this topic had already been touched on in such classical works as Ādāb al-murīdīn (<strong> “The Adepts’ Etiquette”)</strong> by Abū Najīb al-Suhrawardī (died 1168), the founder of the Suhrawardīyyah order and uncle of the author of the oft-translated ʿAwārif al-maʿārif (<strong> “The Well-Known Sorts of Knowledge”</strong> systems in readable form; Ibn al-ʿArabī’s al-Futūḥāt al-Makkīyyah (“The Meccan Revelations”) is the textbook of waḥdat al-wujūd (God and creation as two aspects of one reality). His smaller work on the peculiar character of the prophets—Fuṣūṣ al-ḥikam (<strong> “The Bezels of Wisdom”</strong>)—became even more popular.
